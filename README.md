[**ðŸ¦Œ The Anison Stack**](https://github.com/haidar-dev/anison-stack) by [M Haidar Hanif](https://github.com/mhaidarhanif) is an app development kit with Turborepo, React, Remix, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, MySQL on PlanetScale, Vercel, Docker, and more. It's also possible to bring other things from the JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js ecosystems.

Visit the main demo at [anison.haidar.dev](https://anison.haidar.dev)

The goal is to be more prepared when [building real-world apps and ideas](guides/IDEAS.md), ship things fast, also scale the project easily with many moving parts.

This is a highly opinionated collection of software engineering and web development workflow, monorepo project structure, ready-to-use interactive UI components, feature hooks, and various utilities.

If need something simpler without Turborepo, check out [Rewinds](https://rewinds.mhaidarhanif.com).

### Name and Symbol

Anison means [anime song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime_song), following [Remix Stacks](https://remix.run/stacks) way with music-related names. Or similar to the word "unison", simultaneous performance of action. ðŸ¦Œ means the animal "antelope" so the initial letters rhymes with "anison".
