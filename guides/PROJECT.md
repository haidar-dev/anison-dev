# PROJECT

## Monorepo

When working with monorepo, here are some important aspects to be aware of:

- How to manage and upgrade all dependencies faster? ncu (npm-check-updates)
- How to manage and use environment variables (global env) in the apps?
- How to manage shared assets and images?
- How to enable/disable build cache on local?
- How to resolve "failed to contact turbod"?
- How to manage Tailwind CSS config and styles?
- How to deploy on Vercel or other places properly?
- Do we need to sync different dependencies in apps and packages? Like TypeScript? Yes
- Do we need to cache tasks related to Prisma? No

## Project Structure
