[**ツ Anison Dev**](https://github.com/haidar-dev/anison-dev) by [M Haidar Hanif](https://github.com/mhaidarhanif) is an app development kit with Turborepo, React, Remix, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, MySQL on PlanetScale, Vercel, Docker, and more. It's also possible to bring other things from the JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js ecosystem.

Visit the main demo at [anison.haidar.dev](https://anison.haidar.dev)

The goal is to be more prepared when [building real world apps and ideas](guides/IDEAS.md), ship things fast, also scale the project easily with many moving parts.

This is a highly opinionated collection of software engineering and web development workflow, monorepo project structure, ready to use interactive UI components, functionality hooks and utilities.

If need something simpler without Turborepo, check out [Rewinds](https://rewinds.mhaidarhanif.com).
