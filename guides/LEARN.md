In order:

  - React Router
- Remix
- MySQL
- PlanetScale
- Prisma
- Vercel

## Guiding Principles

- Keep it simple for a quick guide
- Show why and what React is with some visuals
- It is not the whole technical docs and still refer back to react.dev, id.react.dev, react.gg/visualized, roadmap.sh/react, nextjs.org, remix.run, even MDN
- Can start with basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript is fine
- Can avoid extra tooling at first, like using CDN scripts
- Can move forward to understand and use the difference between SPA vs non-SPA, CRA the old way, Vite, Remix, Next.js, Gatsby, Astro, etc
- Can highly recommend to use JSX autocomplete like Emmet and formatter like Prettier before anything else
- Can recommend TypeScript and ESLint for better type safety and code quality
- Can recommend popular options on routing, styling (Tailwind etc), data fetching (RQ etc)
