[**ツ Anison Dev**](https://github.com/haidar-dev/anison-dev) by [Haidar Dev](https://github.com/haidar-dev) ([M Haidar Hanif](https://github.com/mhaidarhanif)) is an app development kit with Turborepo, Remix Stacks, React, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, PlanetScale, Vercel, and more. Also bring favorite stack from the JavaScript/TypeScript/Node.js ecosystem. Visit the main app at [anison.haidar.dev](https://anison.haidar.dev)

The goal is to be more prepared when building real world apps, ship things fast, and scale the project easily with many moving parts. This is a highly opinionated collection of software engineering and web development workflow, project structure, interactive UI components, functionality hooks and utilities.
