## 1. Goal

The application goal and its effect on the business to solve a very specific problem.

- [x] README
- [x] Git repo on GitHub
- [x] Features and team members

The generic and specific tech stack being used for the app development such as:

- Markdown
- Git
- GitHub
- Figma
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- npm and pnpm
- Without API layer
- MySQL on PlanetScale
- Prisma ORM
- Argon2
- Docker and Docker Compose
- React
- Remix, included React Router
- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI
- Vercel

## 2. User Experience

Specify the User Experience (UX) or business logic to accomplish the goal.

- [x] The documentation (docs) about the expectation.
- [x] The flow with a diagram or chart with Eraser.io.

Especially more important if some specific algorithms or data structures would be the core of the app.

## 3. User Interface

Design the User Interface (UI) that will be used by the end users, and then the other type of users.

- [x] Use UI design tool with Figma.

The variety of design formats:

- [x] Mockup
- [x] Prototype

The important design artifacts:

- [x] Pages such as home or landing page, about, auth (register/login), and various pages to use the app that comply with the core UX.
- [x] Layouts such as navigation, header, content, footer, form, and more.

## 4. Data Modeling

Model the database schema to define the tables, fields, data types, and more.

- [x] Use a diagram tool for quick collaboration.
- [x] Use the Prisma Schema file directly.
- [x] Set up the database with MySQL using a Docker container and Docker Compose.
  - [x] Specify the environment variables.
  - [x] Run it locally or in production with a cloud service.
  - [x] Use a platform like PlanetScale.
- [x] Push or migrate the schema to the database.
- [x] Seed the initial data of users and resources/items.

## 5. Backend Development

Implement the backend or server-side layer.

For the backend app or API service:

- [x] With Remix, it provide a backend layer without having a separate backend.

For the API documentation:

- [x] If building a full stack app without a separate backend, the routes would speak for themselves.

Make sure to aligns with the goal and UI/UX.

## 6. Frontend Development

Implement the frontend or client-side layer and UI components that have already been designed before.

For the frontend app:

- [x] Plan for the routes or pages.
- [x] With Remix, the components use React and might be a Multi Page Application (MPA).

For the styling:

- [x] Use Tailwind CSS and some plugins.
- [x] Use unstyled React components like Radix UI.
  - [x] Use the provided UI that adapted from shadcn UI.

## 7. Deployment

Deploy the services for the backend, frontend, or full stack. This can also be done simultaneously while in development from the very beginning.

- [x] Use Vercel to deploy the frontend as full stack, included with a serverless backend.

Make sure everything is working, also can be accessed by the expected users by connecting to a domain.

## 8. Presentation

Present or showcase the app to the actual users. Highlights the features, benefits, and impact of the application.

- [x] Use Screenflow to create the demo video.
- [x] Use Pitch to create the slide deck.

## 9. Maintenance

Maintain the application over time.

- [x] Improve existing functionalities, fix bugs, add new features, update dependencies, also optimize performance and usability.
- [x] Continually gather feedback from users and iterate on the application to improve the user experience and accomplish the goal.
- [x] Use various tools like Better Uptime to monitor the service uptime and Google Lighthouse to measure performance.

## 10. Celebration
